            A blocking operation that does not continue until a response has been

            timed out.

            <remarks>You must not invoke this method on the UI thread, or the call will
            time out. This is because the <see cref="M:System.Net.HttpWebRequest.EndGetResponse(System.IAsyncResult)"/>
            method accesses the UI thread as well, which will starve the worker thread.</remarks>
